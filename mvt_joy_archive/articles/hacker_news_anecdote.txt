My mate has an awesome story about providing technical support to him on campus. I hope neither he nor the deceased mind me relating it.

"Hello. Tech support? This is Manfred von Thun. My computer is not working."

"OK, no problem, do you have a PC or a Mac?"

"Neither."

<Pause>

"Neither?"

"Yes. Neither."

"Ok, what do you have, then?"

"I have a terminal which connects to the mainframe."

<Pause>

"OK, I'll be right over."

Sure enough, he gets there and there's some godforsaken yellowing text-only terminal thing with a wire plugged into some weird port he'd never seen before, presumably wending its way into the bowels of the university to some long-lost, dusty piece of big iron from computing's distant past.

My mate was incredulous. "So what do you do with this, exactly?"

"I write papers, I write programs, I make web pages."

"Web pages!?"

"Yes, web pages. But I don't believe in graphics."

In spite of his protestations about GUIs, he was eventually given a brand spanking new eMac (this was around about the time he was creating Joy). Once he saw Terminal.app, he no longer seemed particularly concerned.
