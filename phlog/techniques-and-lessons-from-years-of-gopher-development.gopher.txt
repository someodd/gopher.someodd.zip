title: Techniques and lessons from years of Gopher development
tags: [haskell, code, gopher]

I am absolutely enamored by the Gopher Protocol. I have spent the past 4+ years developing software for it. For those of you who don't know, the Gopher Protocol is like pre-HTTP/pre-web Internet. Instead of navigating a series of media-rich pages in your web browser, you'd navigate a series of text menus (often with ASCII art!) that are presented like directory listings of multimedia downloads or more text menus!

I started my adventure into the Gopher by building Waffle, a Gopher Protocol client. The point of this project was to help me quickly learn practical Haskell in a decently complicated project.
