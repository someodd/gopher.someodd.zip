Liferea allows you to use a command as a feed source!

1. new subscription
1. in the pop up for new sub click the *advanced* button
1. click the *command* radio button
1. in *source* paste  `curl -s gopher://gopher.someodd.zip:70/0/someodd/phlog/main.xml`
1. OK!

Also, apparently the `gopher` client has a `get` command!
